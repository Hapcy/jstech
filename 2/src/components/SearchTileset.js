Each hour-long episode will expose a grisly homicide set against the backdrop of what appears to be wedded bliss. The series will chronicle many cases including the well-known disappearance of Annie Le, a young beautiful Yale student who vanished before her wedding as well as Gail and Rick Brink, happy newlyweds whose marriage ended in a tragedy and remained unsolved for decades until an unexpected witness revealed a disturbing family secret. From the bride and groom, to a family member, or even a jealous wedding guest - anyone could be the victim or suspect when marriage serves as the powerful catalyst for murder.</p>",
